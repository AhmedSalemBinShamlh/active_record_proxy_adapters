# ActiveRecordProxyAdapters

A set of ActiveRecord adapters that leverage Rails native multiple database setup to allow automatic connection switching from _one_ primary pool to _one_ replica pool at the database statement level.

## Installation

TODO: Replace `UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add 'UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG'

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

## Usage

### On Rails

In `config/database.yml`, use `postgresql_proxy` as the adapter for the `primary` database, and keep `postgresql` for the replica database.

```yaml
# config/database.yml
development:
  primary:
    adapter: postgresql_proxy
    # your primary credentials here

  primary_replica:
    adapter: postgresql
    replica: true
    # your replica credentials here
```

### Off Rails

```ruby
# In your application setup
require "active_record_proxy_adapters"

ActiveSupport.on_load :active_record do
  require "active_record_proxy_adapters/connection_handling"
  ActiveRecord::Base.extend(ActiveRecordProxyAdapters::ConnectionHandling)
end

# in your base model
class ApplicationRecord << ActiveRecord::Base
    establish_connection(
        {
            adapter: 'postgresql_proxy',
            # your primary credentials here
        },
        role: :writing
    )

    establish_connection(
        {
            adapter: 'postgresql',
            # your replica credentials here
        },
        role: :reading
    )
end
```

### Configuration

The gem comes preconfigured out of the box. However, if default configuration does not suit your needs, you can modify them by using a `.configure` block:

```ruby
# config/initializers/active_record_proxy_adapters.rb
ActiveRecordProxyAdapters.configure do |config|
  # How long proxy should reroute all read requests to primary after a write
  config.proxy_delay = 5.seconds # defaults to 2.seconds

  # How long proxy should wait for replica to connect.
  config.checkout_timeout = 5.seconds # defaults to 2.seconds
end
```

### How it works

The proxy will analyze each SQL string, using pattern matching, to decide the appropriate connection for it (i.e. if it should go to the primary or replica).

- All queries inside a transaction go to the primary
- All `SET` queries go to all connections
- All `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` queries go to the primary
- All `SELECT FOR UPDATE` queries go to the primary
- All `lock` queries (e.g `get_lock`) go the primary
- All sequence methods (e.g `nextval`) go the primary
- Everything else goes to the replica

#### TL;DR

All `SELECT` queries go to the _replica_, everything else goes to _primary_.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
